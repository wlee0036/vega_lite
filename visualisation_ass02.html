          <p style="text-align:center; font-size: larger;"> <span style="color:#ff6961; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">Women</span> are more likely to be diagnosed with suicidal thoughts,

                <p>In all countries, the rate of <span style="color:#00c4aa; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">men</span> suicides are <b>greater</b> than <span style="color:#ff6961; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">women</span> suicides. Although women are well-known for higher rates of depression diagnoses as well as suicidal thoughts,
                    men happen to die more from suicides.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Several factors contribute to this phenomena. One key element is the <b>lack of communication</b>. Society has, for many generations, 
                    encourage men to stay strong and not to cast out their emotions as it is believed as a sign of weakness. As a result, men are <b>less likely</b> to seek help
                    when facing emotional problems. Most of them self-treat their depression with <b>alcohol, drugs and other substances</b>. Looks like the <i>'boys don't cry'</i> pressure is
                    causing damaging mental health consequences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Moreover, in a lot of culture, men are the head of the household. They worry more about <b>finances</b> or trying to find a job. When there are economic factors
                  they can't control, it becomes very difficult. In fact, a study in 2015 found that for every <b>1%</b> increase in unemployment there is a <b>0.79%</b> increase in suicide rate.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Men suicides are highest in <b>European</b> countries. Gender disparity in suicide rate are also the biggest in this region. Meanwhile women suicides are highest in <b>Asian</b> countries.
                As can be seen, countries like <i>Sri Lanka</i>, <i>Japan</i>, <i>Republic of Korea</i> lead the rate of women suicide globally.

On the other hand, <span style="color:#00c4aa; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">men</span> experienced a major spike
                during early 90s, reaching the peak at <b>1995</b> with approximately <b>1 out of every 4000</b> population committing suicide annually. The trend has then been <b>decreasing</b> steadily
                with better awareness and suicide prevention strategy by the government. Data for the unprecedented year 2020 would be interesting to look at to see if the trend continues
                given the tough time.</p>

                <p>Generally, the likelihood of suicide <b>increases</b> with a person's age. This might looks surprising given the fact that suicide
                  is one of the <b>leading causes of death</b> among the <b>young</b> people.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>So, why do suicide rate are highest among the <span style="color:#ffda00; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">75+ years</span> age group?
                  Well, this is actually because people aged 70 years above died from <b>numerous</b> reasons: <i>cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke,
                  diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and respiratory diseases</i>. The number of suicide is <b>high</b>, but still generally <b>surpassed</b> by
                  other causes.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>The pattern shows that since the year 1995, suicide rate for everyone aged 15 and above has been constantly <b>decreasing</b>. A
                  significant drop in suicide rate happened in the age group 75+ years. Since 1995, this rate has fall by more than <b>30%</b>. Suicide
                  rate in the <span style="color:#003f5c; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">5-14</span> category remains roughly stable and small with under <b>1 suicide per 100,000</b> population per year.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>
                  Globally, in every continent, the trend of suicide rate increasing with age is true. However, this is not the case in Africa 
                  and Oceania. In <b>Africa</b>, the age group <span style="color:#ff6361; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">35-54 years</span> has the highest suicide rate. Meanwhile, in <b>Oceania</b> the age group <span style="color:#58508d; font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;">15-24 years</span>
                  has the highest suicide rate. This might be due to <b>underrepresentation</b> of countries in both continents, only data of 3 countries
                  were available for Africa and only <i>Australia</i> and <i>New Zealand</i> represents Oceania.

              <h2>There is no clear relationship between
                <br>GDP per capita and suicide rate
              </h2>
              <p>The visualization on the right tells us that there appears to be 
                <br><b>no statistically significant</b> relationship between GDP per capita
                <br>and suicide rate. The relationship might be a little bit prominent
                <br>in specific continent like the <b>Europe</b>, but again this pattern is
                <br>not always seen as year varies.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>The notion that a country's suicide rate decreases as it gets wealthier
                <br>is <b>not true</b>. In fact, we can see that suicide rate is a problem faced
                <br>in all countries globally, regardless of whether they are rich or not.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>For example, <b><i>Australia</i></b>, a country which has been growing rapidly
                <br>in terms of GDP per capita for the last 20 years. In 2015,
                <br>Australia's GDP per capita is approximately <i>60,656</i> almost
                <br><b>triple</b> times than its GDP per capita in 1995. Despite that
                <br>being said, its suicide rate has been slightly <b>higher</b>.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Although <b>money</b> is believed by many as a factor that drives people
                <br>to take their own lives, there are a lot of other socioeconomic
                <br>factors to take into consideration to solve this complex puzzle.
