                <p>In all countries, the rate of men suicides are greater than women suicides. Although women are well-known for higher rates of depression diagnoses as well as suicidal thoughts,
                    men happen to die more from suicides.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Several factors contribute to this phenomena. One key element is the lack of communication. Society has, for many generations, 
                    encourage men to stay strong and not to cast out their emotions as it is believed as a sign of weakness. As a result, men are less likely to seek help
                    when facing emotional problems. Most of them self-treat their depression with alcohol, drugs and other substances. Looks like the 'boys don't cry' pressure is
                    causing damaging mental health consequences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Moreover, in a lot of culture, men are the head of the household. They worry more about finances or trying to find a job. When there are economic factors
                  they can't control, it becomes very difficult. In fact, a study in 2015 found that for every 1% increase in unemployment there is a 0.79% increase in suicide rate.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Men suicides are highest in <b>European</b> countries. Gender disparity in suicide rate are also the biggest in this region. Meanwhile women suicides are highest in <b>Asian</b> countries.
                As can be seen, countries like <i>Sri Lanka</i>, <i>Japan</i>, <i>Republic of Korea</i> lead the rate of women suicide globally.

                <p>Since 1985 to 2016, there has been slightly decreasing trend in women suicide rate. On the other hand, men experienced a major spike
                during early 90s, reaching the peak at 1995 with approximately 1 out of every 4000 population committing suicide annually. The trend has then been decreasing steadily
                with better awareness and suicide prevention strategy by the government. Data for the unprecedented year 2020 would be interesting to look at to see if the trend continues
                given the tough time.</p>

                <h2><i>Suicide rate increases with age</i></h2>
                <p>Generally, the likelihood of suicide increases with a person's age. This might looks surprising given the fact that suicide
                  is one of the leading causes of death among the young people.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>So, why do suicide rate are highest among the 75+ years age group?
                  Well, this is actually because people aged 70 years above died from numerous reasons: cardiovascular disease, cancer, stroke,
                  diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and respiratory diseases. The number of suicide is high, but still generally surpassed by
                  other causes.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>The pattern shows that since the year 1995, suicide rate for everyone aged 15 and above has been constantly decreasing. A
                  significant drop in suicide rate happened in the age group 75+ years. Since 1995, this rate has fall by more than 30%. Suicide
                  rate in the 5-14 category remains roughly stable and small with under 1 suicide per 100,000 population per year.</p>
                  <br>
                <p>
                  Globally, in every continent, the trend of suicide rate increasing with age is true. However, this is not the case in Africa 
                  and Oceania. In Africa, the age group 35-54 years has the highest suicide rate. Meanwhile, in Oceania the age group 15-24 years
                  has the highest suicide rate. This might be due to underrepresentation of countries in both continents, only data of 3 countries
                  were available for Africa and only Australia and New Zealand represents Oceania.

            <br>this line had the same suicide rate in 2015 as they did in 1995.
            <br>Countries which lie above this line had higher rates in 1995, but have improved recently.

              <br>suicide rate, leading the OECD countries. Around 36 people per day
              <br>commited suicide. In Korea, people receive high social pressure ever 
              <br>since they are a kid; academic/school pressures as well as the strict
              <br>parenting culture. The entry requirements to top-tier universities and

            <br>ranking quite high in the Human Development Index. The country used
            <br>to have a very high suicide rate, one of the highest in Europe mainly
            <br>due to high alcohol consumption and Lutheran ethics. Despite its rate

              <h2>There is no clear relationship between
                <br>GDP per capita and suicide rate
              </h2>
              <p>The visualization on the right tells us that there appears to be 
                <br>no statistically significant relationship between GDP per capita and
                <br>suicide rate. The relationship might be a little bit prominent
                <br>in specific continent like the Europe, but again this pattern is
                <br>not always seen as year varies.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>The notion that a country's suicide rate decreases as it gets wealthier
                <br>is not true. In fact, we can see that suicide rate is a problem faced
                <br>in all countries globally, regardless of whether they are rich or not.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>For example, Australia, a country which has been growing rapidly
                <br>in terms of GDP per capita for the last 20 years. In 2015,
                <br>Australia's GDP per capita is approximately 60,656 almost
                <br>triple times than its GDP per capita in 1995. Despite that
                <br>being said, its suicide rate has been slightly higher.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>Although money is believed by many as a factor that drives people
                <br>to take their own lives, there are a lot of other socioeconomic
                <br>factors to take into consideration to solve this complex puzzle.
